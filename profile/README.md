## Hi there 👋


# 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

- CEEMS (Compute Energy & Emissions Monitoring Stack) is a solution to monitor performance, energy and emission metrics of individual compute workloads managed by SLURM, Openstack, and Kubernetes resource managers.
- CEEMS provides three principal components:
    -  A Prometheus exporter and profiling agent that runs on all compute nodes to export usage metrics to Prometheus and application profiling data to Pyroscope servers.
    -  An API server that acts as an abstraction of resource manager to store a list of compute workloads from different resource managers.
    -  An optional load balancer to support multi-tenancy and impose strict access control on Prometheus and Pyroscope servers.
